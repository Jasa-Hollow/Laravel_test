## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

# Tests
*My first steps in this framework.*

This site was built using YouTube channel: [Hilos de Fuego](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm-g2KbMuqYgLU15wz0JYWg).

## First tests
```
It's very simple, using UIkit instead of Bootstrap.
```

```
Well, two days after, I made litle changes, and already preparing things for the CRUD.
```

# CRUD

*Okay, trying to be a good developer, I explain what is a CRUD. Is the acronym of Create, Read, Update and Delete.
I developed a CRUD with Laravel because I'm studying this framework actually.*

###### *Create*
```
First, I created a href to go the create new register's page.
```
![testImage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jasa-Hollow/Laravel_test/main/crud_img/C-1.png)

```
Then, you can see the form, with title and embed link input.
```
![testImage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jasa-Hollow/Laravel_test/main/crud_img/C-2.png)

###### *Read*
```
Okay, to start with, I tell you that it already brings the information from MySQL automatically, 
but it can also be viewed individually. Selecting "See it!" in the options.
```

![testImage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jasa-Hollow/Laravel_test/main/crud_img/R-1.png)

```
Then, you'll see the video you selected before.
```

![testImage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jasa-Hollow/Laravel_test/main/crud_img/R-2.png)

###### *Update*
```
You remind the options we saw in the first "Read" image? 
If you'll select "Edit" option, other view will load.
```
In this, all the values attributes of "input" come from MySQL database, and you can edit these and update.

![testImage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jasa-Hollow/Laravel_test/main/crud_img/U-1.png)

###### *Delete*
```
Don't move from that page!
In it, if you go below from the above, you'll find
the video that has been selected, and below, the option to delete it.
```
